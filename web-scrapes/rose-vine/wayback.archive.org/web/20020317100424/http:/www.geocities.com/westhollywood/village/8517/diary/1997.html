        <B>June 16, 1997</B><BR>
        I am becoming more comfortable talking with friends on the phone 
        while be the girl I am. I don't have that guilty feeling anymore. The 
        feeling that it's not me (the physical me) they're talking to, it's 
        Sarah. I am glad that feeling is going away.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        I decided on using Sarah as my name. I found out it means 
        lady/princess. I am a lady but want to look like a princess.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        I found a costume wig today that I hope my mom will put in the attic 
        so I can take it. It may not be the best but it will work at least 
        until I tell my parents which I am not sure of when and if I will.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>June 29, 1997</B><BR>
        I am hoping my parents will leave me alone for a while sometime soon. 
        I had two and a half hours today but found that was not enough since 
        I didn't know when exactly my parents were going to get home. When I 
        get my drivers license it will become easier to get supplies and 
        become the woman that I am. My hope is that I can go around town as 
        Sarah soon. I suppose though that I will have to get through high 
        school (and perhaps college) before I can make the transition 
        permanently. I very much would like to be a woman. I hope that SRS 
        technology will improve by the time I go ahead with it so I can be as 
        feminine as I possibly can be.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 3, 1997</B><BR>
        Today I had the closest call with being caught as a woman. I saw my 
        moms car pull away and thought I was alone, so I got out of bed and 
        went down stairs (with a night gown on). I decided to check my moms 
        room just in case and she was there. I was lucky that she was sleeping.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 6, 1997</B><BR>
        I was at Kings Dominion (a theme park near where I live) yesterday, 
        and while I was there I thought some more about myself. I discovered 
        more to my transsexualism while I was there. While thinking I 
        couldn't picture myself as a husband or father, the only role I fit 
        into was wife or mother. I wish I could be saved from this male body soon.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 10, 1997</B><BR>
        Today I may have figured out why I may be a transsexual. My mom has 
        always favored my brother and many times she says she wants a girl. I 
        don't know if that caused it but I guess it may have.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 12, 1997</B><BR>
        I was at a friends yesterday, another hard night of not being myself. 
        While there I was able to think a little. We had to drop off my 
        friends sister (lucky she is to be a girl). She was going somewhere 
        with ten other girls. When I was thinking, I realized when I looked 
        at those girls that I really wanted to exchange places with them.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        Girls are the luckiest sex on earth, why must I be a boy?</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 15, 1997</B><BR>
        Today was the first time I told anyone about myself. Even though it 
        wasn't much, I did it. I posted a message on the internet telling 
        people about me. This is just the beginning of my transition.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 17, 1997</B><BR>
        Today was the first time I had ever talked to a friend in person 
        while wearing panties. It happened by accident since I didn't know he 
        was coming. I am very seriously thinking about telling my parents 
        (mom first). I hope they understand and will support me rather than 
        hate me. I will hopefully find out how to tell them, I only have one chance.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 19, 1997</B><BR>
        It is getting harder to write everyday unless something extraordinary 
        happens. Today nothing of that occurred while I was myself, the girl 
        I love so much. It is also getting harder to keep this all a secret. 
        The more I want to be me, the more I do to get as close to Sarah as I 
        can. I might as well tell my mom so she won't find out first.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 20, 1997</B><BR>
        A little over three months until I get my drivers license. Hopefully 
        I will have told my parents by then and I will have no need to have 
        to continue on getting supplies secretly. I very much need my parents support.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 22, 1997</B><BR>
        Right now I feel that just dressing like a woman will get me nowhere 
        and that it is time to tell my parents. Hopefully my courage will 
        come and I will do what I need to and make the next step of my journey.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 23, 1997</B><BR>
        The image of me as a female in the future is stronger now. It is 
        harder to make it through the day without wishing and wanting to be a 
        female physically. It is very hard now to picture me the man in a 
        relationship. I always see myself as a girl. Every woman I see, I 
        picture myself as that woman. There is no way I can stop that until I 
        am the female who I am.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 25, 1997</B><BR>
        I went to a TS girls home page today. Her name is Amanda. I e-mailed 
        her in hope of finding a way to tell my parents. She too, was in this 
        same situation. Right now I am home alone wearing a slip, panty hose 
        and panties and a bra; I was wearing a flowery dress. Now, even 
        dressing like a woman is not enough to comfort the pain I am going 
        through, the pain of being a man. No words can describe how I am 
        feeling. I don't know how I will get through another year of school 
        while being a male.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 28, 1997</B><BR>
        I got a reply from Amanda today. It had a few helpful tips but not 
        enough. She said not to tell my parents unless it is a matter of life 
        or death. Right now it is not but it could be soon. I very much want 
        SRS but I am not the type of person who would kill myself for 
        something. Maybe that will change and then I will have to tell my parents.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>July 29, 1997</B><BR>
        I replied to Amanda today. I really hope she can help me and relieve 
        some of my stress. I found out she was forced to tell her parents, I 
        think this is the best way to go but I have no clue how to get my 
        parents to force it out of me.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>August 3, 1997</B><BR>
        I forgot to write yesterday, oops. It doesn't really matter anyway. 
        My friend came and I had to act male again. I could never imagine me 
        and any of my friends getting married to each other. I might be able 
        to after my transformation, but not now. Now I can see me and some 
        man, but not my friends. I am still thinking about how to tell my 
        parents and continue on into femininity. I am almost positive my mom 
        will support me.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>August 5, 1997</B><BR>
        I have started writing every other day now, or unless something big 
        happens. Depression is overcoming me at night when I think about me, 
        and I think more during the day. It used to be just sometimes during 
        the night when I was depressed. Now it is almost all night and some 
        during the day. I would like to kill off my male side and just leave 
        Sarah but that is impossible. I don't want to die.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>August 7, 1997</B><BR>
        Today is the last night I will be here before I leave for Jekyll 
        Island, Georgia for vacation. I will continue to be Sarah at night 
        there. I will have to be careful not to be caught though. Right now, 
        however, I kind of want to be caught.</P>
       <P ALIGN=LEFT>
        <B>August 13, 1997</B><BR>
        Why must there be separation of the races, or sexes? This world 
        could, and would, be much better, a better place for all. An even 
        better question is why some people can't accept others for who they 
        are? Transsexuals could talk to others (non-transsexuals) freely and 
        not worry. I could tell my parents about who I really am. And maybe 
        even people who think of suicide can talk to someone and not worry 
        about getting in trouble. I wish I could change all that, I wish I 
        could become who I am.</P>

        Why must I be put through this hell? Not only am I deprived of being 
        who I really am, it seems as though my family hates me also. I really 
        do not want to die. I wish there was something to do. This is my last 
        night in Jekyll. I like the change in scenery here as Sarah, even 
        though it is just a room change. I haven't gotten caught yet, 
        hopefully I can keep it that way unless I tell it is better for me to 
        have them know.</P>

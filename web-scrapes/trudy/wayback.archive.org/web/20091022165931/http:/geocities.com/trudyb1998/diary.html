a girl from the countryside, always had the fantasy to go on a holiday to
really become Trudy. After months of planning the day finally came, Trudy went
on her holiday. Her male person packed two sets off clothes and putted everything
in the car. The long drive to the holiday resort could start. It was a dry
afternoon, when after a two hour drive Trudy reached her destination, a holiday
resort with 1000 bungalows in the east of the country. Her bungalow was perfect
for becoming Trudy, it was at the outskirts off the park, standing almost free
from the rest off the bungalows. After unloading the car, she had a quick bite
off dinner and started doing her groceryâ€™s for the weekend. She packed a few
items in a bag and got back in the car. Trudy drove to a few friends, where the

cup off coffee the transformation started. Trudy dressed her self and her
friend did the makeup for her. Finaly when the wig was in its place the
transformation was complete. That night Trudy had agreed to go with her friends
to a meeting for Transvestiteâ€™s. It was Trudyâ€™s first real outing in public,
she never had gone further then a few walks and a few drives in her car. She
never had met a Transvestite in person, so that was extra exiting. After an
hours drive they arrived at the meeting. Parked the car and went in. There
where some 8 transvestite at the meeting. During the evening lots of people
came in. The most exiting thing was that now she new for real she was not
alone. She met a few new interesting friends and a girl who was for the first
time out on her own as well. They started talking about everything from nails
to cleavage. It was a very tiring first night for Trudy, she met a lot off new
people and had a lot of listening and telling to do. 1:30 in the morning she
went to bring her friends back and decided to go back to her cottage as Trudy,
she said goodbye to her friends and started her journey back to </span><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape

took off, she got out off bed and made breakfast, watch some television and

anything about her, she was and looked like a girl. After a walk of a half hour
she came home and started writing her diary for the day. The next day didnâ€™t
happen that much, she just did the things a normal girl does during the day,
reading the paper, watching soaps on television and took a walk in the forest.
She started work on her new homepage, called Totally Trudy, where this diary
will be posted. After 36 hours, Trudy got the rest off the day of and her male
self went to do the shopping, a girl should drink and eat. That afternoon her
male self went into the city and bought a dress for Trudy, for a new type off
Trudy for the web page. It was a red latex dress, when she got home she got
back to being Trudy and eat her dinner and shot some photoâ€™s off her self in
her new dress for the WebPages. The next morning Trudy got up early to enjoy
the whole day off being Trudy, she made coffee, picked up her mail and wrote a
E-mail to some friends. It was a sunny day, the first day off spring, she
wanted to get out, but her nerves didnâ€™t let her do it. At night Trudy went out
a few times. The next morning she was expecting visitors, so she had to become
her male self again. But at the end off the day Trudy came alive again. Her
homepage was coming along nicely. She only needed some more pictures, so she
started experimenting with her photo-editing program. She found out a few new
tricks and started editing pictures for her website. The rest off the holiday
she enjoyed being Trudy. When the day came that she had to go home, she had
broken all her records of being Trudy.</span></p>

<p>
Hello all!<br>
I wanted to take a brief minute to describe last nights Pokalspiel (Tournament Game).  I have no idea what the name of the tournament is, but we had a game stolen from us.  We got to play on our home field, so the other team got to choose the referee.  I thought moving to Germany would make me immune to very, very bad officiating, however, I was wrong.  This game ranks up there in the top 5 worst refereed games of all time (in which I participated 4 times).<br>
I cannot play because of injury and the lack of a Player's Pass (anyone who can tell whomever [Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton, Kenneth Starr, Jesse Helms] is holding up the U.S. Soccer Federation from saying that I was never a professional and am not contracted to a team in the U.S., please do so.  Then I can play in real games.  They really want me to.).  My injury is healing relatively slowly, but I should be able to run on Thursday.  I will run again on Tuesday and then see if me Spielpaß is there.  If so, I will try playing again next Thursday.  If not, I will probably only run next Thursday and try it again the following Thursday.  But anyone who knows me, knows that I am impatient with injuries.  This is killing me.<br>
Anyway, I was the linesman on one side of the field.  The referee overruled me on a line call where I was standing on the line and he was standing in the middle of the field.  He did the same to the other linesman.  But that was the least of the concerns.  On the field, our team plays hard and usually gets about the same number of fouls as the other side.  Usually less.  After the first half, I decided that I should count the number of fouls called on each team because I thought it was inordinately one-sided.  There were two fouls called on the other team during the second half.  There were <B>15</B> fouls called against us.  Even with that balance, we were controlling the game, but fell behind early in the second half, 2-1.<br>
Midway through the second half, we tied the score.  Then, we controlled the game.  We got scoring chance after scoring chance, but could not seem to put the game away.  It ended in a tie.  However, in tournament play, you cannot have a tie, so we played overtime.  We dominated the first overtime, but again could not push in the go ahead goal.  Fouls here were about 10 against us and 3 against them.  Then came the most unbelievable call I have ever seen.  On a corner kick, the ball was headed directly up in the air by our defender.  As he went to head the ball away, one of there men drove his shoulder into our defenders face sending them both sprawling.  The whistle blew and even the other team began to head in the other direction.  But the referee called an <B>Elfmeter (Penalty Kick)</B>.  In a tie game in overtime, he decides to give the game to the other team.  Our players went ballistic, the coach, the manager, the fans and other members of the team stormed on to the field to confront the referee.  No one could believe it.  All of this resulted in 2 red cards and the Elfmeter was still on.<br>
But you think that is the end of the story. <B>NO!</B>  Our keeper saved the penalty kick only to have the original shooter then put the ball into the back of the net.  Yet another failure on the referee's behalf.  The original shooter may not touch the ball again until it has been touched by someone other than the opposing keeper.  The keeper stormed the referee, twisting him around so violently that I thought his little bald head would bounce off like a cue ball.  However, not even he could give out a third red card.  That would make it too obvious.<br>
But you think that is the end of the story. <B>NO!</B>  With <B>9</B> men on the field we dominated the last five minutes of the game.  We had five scoring chances and then came the last questionable call.  A handball occurred right at the edge of the box.  To make the count even, most referees are going to call anything close an Elfmeter because they do not want to be the cause of a win or a loss.  This guy did not even call a foul.  The ball bounded to a covered player and he said that the advantage was there and to play on.  <B>Unbelievable!</B><br>
The game ended 3-2.  Needless to say, the referee was hawked off the field to the dressing room.  Then, our manager tried to get into the dressing room to confront the referee to get his license number, etc. to take a formal protest to the Hessische Fußball Bund.  The other coach prevented him from going into the Schietsrichterkabine.  Forcibly.  There was some pushing and shoving.  Finally, things settled down.  I decided to go home at that point as there was no reason to see another scene or learn the words which went with the scene.  I hope this guy loses his right to referee matches, because he was really awful.<br>
On the home front, we have a contract on the house in Virginia! <B>YEAH!</B>  It should close at the end of September.  Then, Michelle has to work out a few things (like there is an embargo on shipping animals from Virginia because of the heat, etc.).  Hopefully, she will be over here by the end of October.  Keep your fingers crossed for us.<br>
On the work front, we have a new issue.  The product is so delayed that we are pushing into some legal issues.  We have to have the product working with the new EURO currency for the beginning of the year.  That means it must be in production test by the first of December.  The new production date for the first version is November 16.  Notice the proximity of the dates.  It is a political football right now and I am trying to pass it as I am the quarterback.  I definitely will not get sacked.  Enough sports metaphors.  The bottom line is that Upper Level Management (above me) needs to work out how to deal with the problem.  I have given a number of different solutions.  None seems to be pallatable to them right now, so we will stay the course and try to make the quick turn-around work.<br>
<br>
Let me here from you to learn how you are doing.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
Hank<br>

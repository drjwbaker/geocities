Hello All!<br>
Well, I did not do as well as I wanted, but I have some good excuses to tell.  There were over 13.000 people who started the race.  A co-worker and I forced ourselves toward the front (probably about 2000 people in front of us).  As we started, the first 200-300 got a good jump on everyone (everyone was supposed to line up based on how much time they needed per mile, we stepped up between 6 and 7 minutes).  I think it took us a good 3 minutes to get to the start line.  Then, it was like a slalom course.  We jogged in and out of the people who only wanted to start early.  This meant we sped up and slowed down quite a lot.  We got to the first km marker and the time said 7:14, so I figure we did the first km in about 4:30 minutes through the slalom course.  I knew that this was too fast a pace for me, but I figured that I had to keep it up until we negotiated our way around the slower runners.  We got to the second km marker at 12:30, so I figured that the pace was now more like what I needed, so I settled in with the bunch (about 200) runners around me.  I was struggling a bit as we reached the third km marker, but the pace was still 17:59, so I was doing well.<br>
But here, I made my fatal mistake.  There was a water stand set up , so I forced my way over to get some water.  This slowed me down, but I figured I needed hydration and cooling off.  I should have just poured the entire cup over my head, but I took a drink.  I was mineral water (with carbonation).  I got to about the 3.5 km marker and got the worst stitch in my side.  I couldn't get air.  I had to slow down the pace quite a bit.  This let a number of slower runners past, so that when I finally worked the stitch out (at the 4 km marker), I had to do the slalom course again.  I was tired, very tired when we reached the 5 km marker.  The time explained was 29:10, so I really wanted to finish hard.  I put everything I had left into the last 0,6km.  I finished with a time of 32:40.  Adjusted for the start, the time was 30:40.  It was about 3 minutes slower than I wanted, but I figure with the starting and stopping and the cramp, I did very well.  The winner finished in 16:34.  At least my time (even unadjusted) was not twice that of the winner.  I am satisfied and dissatisfied at the same time.<br>
Maybe next year I will do better.  All-in-all, we had a good time with lots of comraderie.  Today and tomorrow I will probably pay the price of this run, but the weekend is ahead for recovery.  I will do it again next year and enjoy it just as much.  I will probably run differently, but I will run it all the same.  The race did not start until 19:30.  It ended for me at 20:00, but then we had a cool down area and then drinks and finally our prize for finishing.  To get this prize, 13.000 people had to push by 15 or 20 tables.  We did not reorganize until 21:00.  I can't imagine the people behind me.  I finished in the center of the pack.  We then had a bier to celebrate.  I got home by 10:30 (needless to say the walk from the subway station to the apartment up the hill was a little longer than usual).  I basically collapsed after a shower.<br>
<br>
That's the news from Frankfurt.<br>
Take care,<br>
Hank
